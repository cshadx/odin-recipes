# odin-recipes
My "recipe project" - a website solely in HTML made for The Odin Project

Four webpages: an index, and one for each of the three recipes (chicken tikka shawarma, the greatest burger and sauce, and spicy onion rings)

Utilized HTML skills learned from the beginning foundations lessons of TOP - boilerplate, paragraphs, headings, bold/italic text, lists, absolute & relative links

Combined these elements within each other as necessary. May revisit this project after learning CSS elements to make it look nicer, indent things, resize pictures, etc.

Used and got comfortable with git and terminal commands for the whole project
