    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a combination of the ever-popular shawarma hailing from the Middle East and 
        the delicious Chicken Tikka Masala from India. From my personal experience, shawarmas 
        are typically a bit dry, spiceless, and sometimes lacking flavor, while Chicken Tikka Masala 
        seems to deliver so much flavor that you can get tired of it after a bit. The rich spices 
        and creaminess of the masala will work to balance out the dryness of the shawarma, and vice 
        versa. It's a match made in heaven!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For Chicken</h3>
    <h4>Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>28 oz Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast, chopped up into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tsp Garam Masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground Cumin</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger (can use paste)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red chili powder (or a different chili powder)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking oil of choice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1.25 cups heavy or thickened cream</li>
        <li>14 oz tomato puree (or tomatoes to blend in the cream)</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp garlic, finely grated or minced</li>
        <li>Same amounts of the spices listed in the "Marinade" Section</li>
        <li>Cilantro/coriander for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Shawarma</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pita bread</li>
        <li>Tahini Sauce or:</li>
        <li>0.5 cup Tahini paste + 1 tbsp olive oil + 0.5 lemon, juiced + salt</li>
        <li>Olives, crushed (optional)</li>
        <li>Peppers (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all marinade ingredients with the chicken in a ziploc bag.</li>
        <li>Store in fridge for up to 48 hrs; the longer you marinate, the better! If you can only do an hour or two, make some light cuts in the chicken so it can absorb everything better.</li>
        <li>After taking the chicken out of the fridge, it's time for the sauce. Start with a pan or skillet on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, toss in some cooking oil of choice or butter.</li>
        <li>Throw in butter and onions; let cook until golden (3-4 mins).</li>
        <li>Toss in ginger and garlic, let cook for 30 seconds. Be sure to stir to prevent burning.</li> 
        <li>Add in marinated chicken, tomato puree, and all spices from the marinade section in same quantities. Use more butter if desired. Stir well to mix and cook over medium-high heat for 5-6 minutes. (Note: if using tomatoes, blend them with some cream first to make a puree - this is necessary for good masala.)</li>
        <li>Add in your heavy cream and simmer for 8-10 mins, stirring occasionally throughout.</li>
        <li>While the chicken tikka masala is simmering, start preparing your shawarma wrap - olive oil on a pan over medium heat, put on pita bread (2-3 minutes each side or to preference).</li>
        <li>If you don't have tahini sauce, combine tahini paste, lemon juice, and olive oil in a bowl. Spread this on your toasted pita bread.</li>
        <li>Put on some crushed olives and peppers if desired.</li>
        <li>Put your chicken tikka masala onto the pita bread, wrap it up, and voila! A good tip is to not put too much of the masala sauce in the wraps themselves, and instead leave some to dip the wraps in while eating. Enjoy!</li>
