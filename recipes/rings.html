    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mouthwatering, crispy spicy onion rings, with a sauce of choice that perfectly accompanies that spicy crunch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder (or chili powder of choice)</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp ginger-garlic powder</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>0.5 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>0.5 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your onion(s) into 5-7 mm slices, separating the rings from each other.</li>
        <li>Setup your seasoning/breading station: Combine all dry ingredients, but save some baking powder and flour.</li>
        <li>Setup your batter station: whisk an egg, pour in your buttermilk, and put in the remaining baking powder and flour. Combine.</li>
        <li>Coat your onion slices well in the dry mixture, then dip them in the batter. Gently shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Here is the key: put your already-coated onion slice BACK in the dry mixture, essentially double-coating it.</li>
        <li>Heat your oil in a pot of choice over a medium flame. Once it's around 365 F (should be bubbling), SLOWLY work your rings in from the surface, spinning them around a bit in the oil and then releasing.</li>
        <li>After about 3-4 minutes, your onion rings should be golden-brown. Go ahead and take them out, drying off the excess oil with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Serve with a sauce of choice, my favorite with these is chipotle mayo. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
